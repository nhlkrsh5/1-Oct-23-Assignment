
Differences between Flexbox and Grib:

Flexbox:


One-dimensional Layout: Flexbox is primarily designed for creating one-dimensional layouts—either as rows or columns.

Content Order: Flexbox allows reordering of elements using the order property without changing the source order in the HTML.

Alignment Control: Excellent for aligning items along the main axis or the cross axis using properties like justify-content, align-items, and align-self.



Grid:


Two-dimensional Layout: Grid is designed for creating two-dimensional layouts—both rows and columns simultaneously.

Alignment and Spacing: Provides precise control over both row and column alignment, as well as spacing between elements, using properties like grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-gap.

Grid Lines and Tracks: Offers grid lines and tracks allowing for more complex layout configurations.
